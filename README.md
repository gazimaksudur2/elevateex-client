Assalamualikum vai,
Here I'm requesting you about my submission. Please take patience while evaluating my submission. I've completed all the assignments in time and scored well previously. My score is safe for SCIC but there requires at least 70% on this assignment and I'm scaring for that.In recent times, I've experienced a lot of troubles like my semester final starts and also I was sick for more than a week. So, I didn't able to complete my assignment 12 on time. Now I did as much as I can in my Eid vacation time. Please do not disappoint me in this case, here this was my dream to get into the SCIC.
